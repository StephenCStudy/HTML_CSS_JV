    It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds <br>
    the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall <br> 
    appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with <br> 
    custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML <br>
    can go within the <span id="color">.accordion-body</span>, though the transition does limit overflow.</p>
